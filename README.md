# Automat
This plugin lets you run executables when events happen JIRA. For each selected event you can create an executable, it will be executed each time JIRA sends a notification. Plugin currently supports issue events, user events and custom events.

For example you can run a script when issue is updated, or created, or commented, etc.

You can find full list of supported events on plugin's configuration page.
